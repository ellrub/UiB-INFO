In this assignment, you will create four coherent HTML documents. The task
focuses on simple, clean, and correct HTML code. In this assignment, we are less
concerned with details such as colors, font size and fonts, and other visual
expressions. But the content presented on the pages must be available (text
should not have the same color as background; text and images should not be
so large that it will be difficult to see the content; etc.). It is allowed to use
Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), however, the assignment deals only with HTML.
