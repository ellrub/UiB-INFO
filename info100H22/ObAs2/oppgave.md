INFO100 Basic Course in Information Science CSS Assignment

In this assignment, you will gain practical experience in using CSS to create web
pages that look good on different equipment, such as regular computers,
tablets and mobiles. While HTML is suitable for overall structuring the
organization of the web pages, CSS is designed to control visual details, such as
colors, font sizes, and font types. CSS is mainly useful for aesthetic reasons â€“ to
make web pages pretty. In addition, CSS can be used to visualize data formats
other than HTML, such as XML, which we will look at later. References to
literature in the previous lab paper (Codeacademy and W3C) also cover material
on CSS. You can still use those resources. You'll also be using the HTML
documents you created last week.

1 CSS In this assignment, you will create CSS files for the web pages you
created in the previous assignment.

1.a) The content of the page shall be in the middle of the page and adapt if the
browser window is resized.

1.b) The page should have a header with the page title and a footer with contact
information.

1.c) Headings ("heading" elements) should be centered/centered.

1.d) Try out different font types and find one that fits the style you are aiming
for.

1.e) Block elements (structure) must have margins and padding to place the
content in a clear and structured manner. At least one element should have
background color(s) and/or borders around it.

1.f) The navigation elements must be stylized so that they are perceived and
behave like navigation menus (the menus should have buttons that are
highlighted when you hover over them). Use a-elements for this styling.

1.g) The web pages should automatically adapt to the screen size, so that they
look good on both a regular computer and a smartphone. This means that the
content of the page must change so that it still looks nice when you resize the 
browser window. In Firefox, you can also see how the content looks at different
sizes by enabling Responsive Design Mode.
