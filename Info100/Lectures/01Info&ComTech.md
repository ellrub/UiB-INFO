# Lecture 1 Information and communications technologi
## What is information and informationtechnology?
* Information is generally processed, organized and structured data.
* Information offers a context for data and enables action decisions.
* Information technology is the use of computers to create, process, store and exchange all types of digital data and information.
* Information technology is typically used in business operations as opposed to personal or entertainment technologies.
* Information and communication technology is IT that also contains communication between people.

## Digitizing information
* Digitizing means representing information in a digital way.
* Digital means that something is countable.
* Digital comes from the Latin "digitalis" which means finger.
* Digitization is representing analog information in a discreet manner.
* The computer can only work with digital information.

## Binary system
* Presence and Absence
* Either on or off

| Present  | Absent    |
|:--------:|:---------:|
| True     | False     |
| 1        | 0         |
| On       | Off       |
| Yes      | No        |
| +        | -         |
| Black    | White     |
| For      | Against   |
| Yang     | Yin       |
| X        | Y         |

## Decimal vs Binary
* Position number system with a different base number (10 and 2)
* Computers use binary numbers
* There are two numbers in the binary system, 0 and 1.

|  Power |    Decimal   |  Binary |
|:------:|--------------|:-------:|
|   0    | 1 = 10⁰      | 1 = 2⁰  |
|   1    | 10 = 10¹     | 2 = 2¹  |
|   2    | 100 = 10²    | 4 = 2²  |
|   3    | 1000 = 10³   | 8 = 2³  |
|   4    | 10,000 = 10⁴ | 16 = 2⁴ |


# The History of Digital Computers
* Representing data as numbers was a breakthrough then machines could handle digital information.
* Census data card (1890)
    * Herman Hollerith made one machine that could count/read data based on holes in cards.
    * He is considered the first person who made machine for to use digital information.

## IBM continues the punch cards
 * Herman Hollerith co-develops IBM punch card technology (1924).
 * Can process information from punch cards.

## Punch cards
* A hole card is moved to the left by a metal roll.
* Above the roller is a bundle metal wires called brush.
* As the hole moves over the roller, stick the brush through the hole and touches the roller, forming a electrical connection.
* When the machine registers the presence of the hole, sender it signaled on to another part of the machine for further processing.

## Punch card machines
* Punch card machines were electromechanical devices.
* It was hardware built by wires, rollers and motors.
* To change operations had to it is rewired.
* Main problem:
    * Only very simple operations were possible when the "program" became expressed using wires.

## Enigma (cipher) – Arthur Scherbius
* Cryptography – the science of encryption and decrypt messages.
* Encryption – converting plain text to encrypted text.
* Decryption – conversion of encrypted text to plain text.
* Plain text – the original readable the message.
* Cipher text - the secret the message you cannot read normally.
* Key – the settings used to encrypt and decrypt.
* Number of keys in Enigma machine: 158.962.555.217.826.360.000

## Turing machine
A Turing machine processes a finite number of symbols read from a paper strip, out from a limited number of given rules and based on
the state it is in. The reading of a symbol can affect both the machine's state, and which symbol then must be read. The strip can be infinite, but number of symbols, number of rules and number possible states must be finite.

## Integrated circuits
* The problem of making circuit boards with transistors, capacitors and wiring is solved with integrated circuits.
* Chip is made by integrating transistors on a chip (IC).

## Software (Apps)
* Give instructions to the computer so that it does what we want.
* The computer does what we ask it to do about, no more, no less.

## Algorithms
* An algorithm is a precise, systematic method for arriving at a specified result.
* We use and create algorithms to solve our problems.

#### 5 properties an algorithm must have
1. Input data for the algorithm
2. Output the algorithm should produce
3. The process is unambiguous
4. The algorithm is as efficient as possible
5. The algorithm is finite

## The information sphere
* Since the 1950s, computer science has exercised both an extroverted and inward influence, and not only changed our interaction with the world, but also our self-understanding.
* In many ways we are not standalone entities, but rather interconnected information organisms or "inforgs", which share biological agents and engineered objects a global environment that to finally consists of information, the infosphere.
