2a)When the user logs into the problem-solving webpage and opens her profile page, the system needs to display her personal information such as full name and affiliation. To do this, the person.xml document is used. This XML file contains the user’s ID, full name, and institutional affiliation, which together represent her profile data. The document is sent from the server to the client, because the server stores the user’s information in its database and retrieves it when the user logs in. The browser (client) then receives this XML data and displays it in a readable format on the profile page.

2b)When the user wants to submit a solution proposal, the system needs to send information about the answer she has written. In this case, the answer.xml document is used. This document contains the author’s name, the ID of the question being answered, and the actual answer text. The document is sent from the client to the server, because the user (client) creates and submits the answer through the webpage, and the server needs to receive and store this XML data in its database so that it can later be displayed to other users or reviewed by an administrator.
